# Bacteria-Infectious-Disease-Ontology
The Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology (BIDO) is an extension of IDO that will serve as a reference ontology concerning bacterial pathogens. In turn it will serve as a hub for IDO extensions concerning specific bacterial infectious diseases. It mirrors the Virus Infectious Disease Ontology in that respect.

BIDO imports relevant molecular entities from CHEBI, proteins from PRO and cellular components and processes from GO, linking them together via new axioms. The relevance of imported terms to bacterial pathogenicity is highlighted by the addition of axioms linking them to key IDO terms such as 'virulence factor', 'toxin', 'invasion factor' and 'adhesion factor'.
